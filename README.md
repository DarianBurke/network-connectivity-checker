<h1>Network Connectivity Checker</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates a simple Python script that tests network connectivity between two Windows 11 virtual machines and an external site (Google DNS). 
The script pings each host to verify whether it is reachable, providing a clear demonstration of both local VM network communication and external connectivity.

This project complements the Windows VM Networking Lab by showing how Python can be used to automate basic network testing tasks.
